# Hello-World
My first repository at GitHub
This is my first branch
I am making commit to this file for checking if I understands the concept of making changes in code. 
This is really fun..!!
I love doing hands-on over code.
The changes should be made only in branch and not in the Master.
After merging the file from readme-edits, the readme-edits branch have been deleted. 
Its the only copy of our code done so far.
so be careful now to npt delete it mistakenly.. :)
